                        <br>The Engineer is a soft-spoken, amiable Texan from Bee Cave, Texas, USA with an interest in all mechanical things. He specializes in constructing and maintaining 
                        buildings that provide support to his team, rather than being a front line class, making him the most suitable for defense. The Engineer's various gadgets include the Sentry Gun, an automated turret that fires at any enemy in range, the Dispenser, a device that restores the health and ammunition of nearby teammates, and Teleporters that quickly transport players from point A to point B.</br>

                        <br>Because the Engineer's ingenious devices are under constant threat from explosives and devious enemy Spies, a good Engineer 
                        must keep his gear under a watchful eye and under repair with his Wrench at all times. When the Engineer needs to get his hands dirty, his trio of generic yet capable weapons, along with the assistance of his helpful hardware, make him more than capable of holding his own in a fight. If need be, the Engineer can even pick up and haul constructed buildings to redeploy them in more favorable locations. While usually viewed as a defensive class, the Engineer has a selection of high-tech weapons that allow him to destroy projectiles or to build faster-deploying, less damaging Sentry Guns, which give him great utility at the front lines too. His Teleporters are also a key point to both the offensive and defensive team's success, allowing slower, heavier classes to reach the front-lines quicker.</br>
                   
                        <br>The Engineer is voiced by Grant Goodeve in the game, and by Nolan North in the short film Expiration.<br>

                        <br>The Heavy Weapons Guy, more commonly known as the Heavy, is a towering hulk of a man hailing from the USSR. He is often considered the face of the game, due to his prominent appearance on box-art, promotional materials, and loading screens. He starred in the very first Meet the Team video, and has appeared in all further movies to date. </br>
                        <br>The Heavy is the largest and arguably most dangerous class in Team Fortress 2 - boasting the most base health, combined with the devastating firepower of his trusty Minigun. This weapon can inflict huge damage at a very high rate of fire, allowing him to mow down opposing Heavies, cowards, and tiny-baby-men in mere seconds. However, as the slowest class in the game, the Heavy's low movement speed is his main weakness, making him an appealing target for Snipers and Spies. Upon revving up or firing his Minigun, this already unimpressive speed slows to a crawl, making it even easier for enemies to damage him. As a result, the Heavy is often dependent on support from Medics and Engineers to keep him in the fight. Thanks to his burly stature, he also takes 50% less knockback from most damage sources - excluding Sentry Gun bullets.</br>
                        <br>Aside from shredding entire teams when adequately supported, the Heavy is able to provide limited healing for himself and his comrades via his Sandvich, which, when consumed, is capable of restoring him to perfect health within seconds. It can also be dropped to provide an instant, often-appreciated 50% health boost to his teammates, equal to a medium health kit. However, if the Heavy is not careful, an opportunistic enemy may pick up the dropped Sandvich for a health boost of their own.</br>
                        <br>The Heavy is voiced by Gary Schwartz.</br>

                        <br>The Medic is a German man of questionable medical practices from Stuttgart, Germany. As the only class with a consistent healing source,
                         he is often found near the front lines bolstering his teammates. Although the Medic's Syringe Gun and Bonesaw aren't the most excellent weapons for direct combat, he can typically still be found near the front lines, healing wounded teammates while trying to stay out of enemy fire.</br>
                        <br>When the Medic focuses his Medi Gun on a nearby teammate, they will gradually regain health; patients who are already at full health have their health temporarily
                         increased up to 150% of their base health capacity, allowing them to fight more aggressively. However, teammates who have not taken damage recently are healed faster, encouraging other players withdrawals when injured.</br>
                        <br>When healing, the Medic gradually fills a unique ÜberCharge bar, which can fill faster if healing injured or not-fully-overhealed teammates. When the ÜberCharge bar is fully charged, the Medic's Medi Gun begins to crackle, accompanied by small electric team-colored particles at its tip, indicating that he can now deploy a unique charge to benefit his healing target (and himself) for eight seconds. A charge from the Medi Gun offers temporary invulnerability; a charge from the Kritzkrieg grants guaranteed Critical hits to your heal target; the Quick-Fix grants rapid healing,
                         along with immunity to knockback and compression blasts from Pyros; and the Vaccinator grants enhanced damage resistance to a specific damage type (bullets, explosives, and fire).</br>
                        <br>Although the Medic cannot heal himself with his Medi Gun (unless using the Quick-Fix's ÜberCharge or the Kritzkrieg's Oktoberfest taunt), he is capable of passively regenerating health over time. The longer he stays out of combat and avoids taking damage, the faster he will heal. By default, an injured Medic begins regenerating health at a rate of 3 points per second, increasing over the following ten seconds to a maximum of 6 health per second, though this base rate
                         increases while holding the Amputator and is reduced if the Blutsauger is equipped. Healing injured teammates will double the current rate of health regeneration, encouraging the Medic to heal them over healthy patients.</br>
                        <br>The Medic's lower firepower and combat abilities mean that he is more reliant on his teammates defending him than his own weapons defending him. The Syringe Gun's
                         slow projectiles and low damage makes it hard to fight any class head on, while the Bonesaw's limited range puts the Medic in considerable danger.</br>
                        <br>The Medic is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes.</br>

                        <br>The Soldier is a crazed, jingoistic patriot from Midwest, USA, who portrays himself as a military man despite being rejected from the US army. Tough and well-armed,
                         he is a versatile class, capable of both offense and defense, and a great starter class to get familiar with the game.</br>
                        <br>The Soldier is a crazed, jingoistic patriot from Midwest, USA, who portrays himself as a military man despite

                        <br>The Soldier is well known for his spectacular rocket jump. In defiance of all good sense and judgment, the Soldier can detonate a rocket at his feet and launch himself skyward at the cost of some health (which can be reduced by the Gunboats, or negated altogether with the Rocket Jumper). To rocket jump effectively, the player must fire the rocket at the ground or a wall,
                         then immediately jump and crouch. This ability allows the Soldier to navigate the battlefield by air, appear from unexpected places, and reach areas inaccessible to the Scout's double jump and HYPE jumps. After rocket jumping, the Soldier can remain airborne for longer by deploying the B.A.S.E. Jumper.</br>
                        <br>The Soldier was voiced by the late Rick May. He was voiced by May and Nolan North in Expiration Date.</br>
